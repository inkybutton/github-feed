This little Ruby app fetches the public timelines
of all members of an organisation and pushes the
last N results to a gist.

It is originally designed to run on Heroku, taking
advantage of Heroku's scheduler to run the fetcher
every 10 minutes, but it can also be run elsewhere.

The only requirement is to set this environment
variable:

  GITHUB_AUTH="login:password"

Be sure to also read the config.yml file and its
comments. The app code itself isn't very long nor
complex, so read up if you wish.
